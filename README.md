Semantic HTML Refactor

Thee goal of this project was to make the index.html for a webpage more accessible by converting non-semantic elements to semantic elements and adding alt text to images, as well as to maintain the stylistic integrity of the webpage by adapting the CSS to reflect the changes made to the HTML as well as eliminate redundancies in the CSS, making the code more concise.
